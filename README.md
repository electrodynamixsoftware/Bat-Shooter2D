//I'm Neo Nkomo. I am the founder of Electrodynamix Software. I am currently doing my first game project as a way to get my feet wet in game development.
//It has been a year since I've wanted to make a game, but I haven't gotten around to it
//So I told myself, that atleast this year I'll do the hardest part: BEGINNING!!
//I've already gotten a few steps forward, I've created a world, player, enemies and a killzone.
//SO LET'S HAVE SOME FUN!!!
